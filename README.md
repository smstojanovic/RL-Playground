# Rl-Playground

This is my repo for playing around with either RL or creating games and creating RL-systems around them.

There are some folders are set up here:

- games (for custom game code)
- environments (for environments that provide MDP type framework around these games (states, actions and rewards))
- qlearning (for some preliminary q-learning scripts)
